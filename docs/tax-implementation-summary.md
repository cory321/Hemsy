## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Setting Tax Rate**

1. Seamstress goes to Settings → Business tab
2. Scrolls to "Sales Tax" card
3. Enters their local tax rate (e.g., 7.5 for 7.5%)
4. Clicks "Save Settings"
5. Rate stored in `shops.tax_percent`

### **Tax Calculation**

```typescript
// Current flow (unchanged):
const subtotal = calculateSubtotal();
const afterDiscount = subtotal - discountCents;
const taxAmount = Math.round((afterDiscount * taxPercent) / 100);
const total = afterDiscount + taxAmount;
```

### **Invoice Display**

```
Services:          $100.00
Discount:          -$10.00
Subtotal:          $90.00
Tax (7.5%):        $6.75
                   ↑ Calculated at merchant's rate
────────────────────────────────
Total:             $96.75

Tax calculated at merchant's configured rate.
Merchant is responsible for tax compliance.
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **What This Does NOT Do**

❌ Automatic multi-jurisdiction tax calculation  
❌ Tax threshold monitoring  
❌ Automatic rate updates  
❌ Filing assistance  
❌ Nexus determination  
❌ Product-specific tax rules

### **What This DOES Do**

✅ Clear UI for setting tax rate  
✅ Legal disclaimers protect platform  
✅ Encourages address collection  
✅ Transparently shows merchant responsibility  
✅ Simple and fast for MVP  
✅ $0 additional cost

## 🔄 **Migration from Manual to Stripe Tax (Future)**

When ready for Phase 2, seamstresses can:

1. Enable Stripe Tax in settings (toggle switch)
2. Configure tax registrations via embedded component
3. System automatically switches from manual calculation to Stripe Tax API
4. Historical orders keep manual tax
5. New orders use automatic calculation

**No data loss**, **seamless transition**, **opt-in basis**

## 📋 **User Education**

When seamstress signs up, prompt them to:

- [ ] Set their sales tax rate in Settings
