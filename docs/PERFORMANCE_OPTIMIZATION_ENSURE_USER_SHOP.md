# Performance Optimization: ensureUserAndShop Caching

## Problem

The `ensureUserAndShop` function was being called redundantly during dashboard loads, causing:

- **10 separate calls** to the same function in a single request
- 10x the console logs
- 10x the Clerk API calls
- 20x the database queries
- Unnecessary performance overhead

## Analysis

During dashboard load, these server components made parallel calls to `ensureUserAndShop`:

### BusinessOverviewServer (4 calls)

- `getBusinessHealthData()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`
- Direct call to `ensureUserAndShop()`
- `getRecentActivity(5)` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`

### AppointmentsFocusServer (3 calls)

- `getNextAppointment()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`
- `getTodayAppointmentsDetailed()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`
- `getWeekOverviewData()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`

### GarmentPipelineServer (2 calls)

- `getGarmentStageCounts()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`
- `getActiveGarments()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`

### DashboardAlertsServer (2 calls)

- `getOverdueGarmentsForAlert()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`
- `getGarmentsDueTodayForAlert()` → calls `ensureUserAndShop`

**Total: 10 redundant calls**

## Solution

Implemented React cache to deduplicate calls within the same request cycle:

```typescript
// Before
export async function ensureUserAndShop(): Promise<UserWithShop> {
  // ... implementation
}

// After
export const ensureUserAndShop = cache(async (): Promise<UserWithShop> => {
  // ... same implementation
});
```

## Benefits

- **90% reduction** in Clerk API calls (10 → 1)
- **95% reduction** in database queries (20 → 2)
- **90% reduction** in console logs (10 → 1)
- **Significantly faster** dashboard load times
- **Better user experience**

## Technical Details

- Uses React's `cache()` function from React 18+
- Automatically deduplicates calls within the same request cycle
- Zero breaking changes to existing code
- Maintains all existing error handling and logging
- Console logs now indicate cache misses vs hits

## Verification

The optimization can be verified by:

1. Checking console logs - should only see one `[ensureUserAndShop]` log per dashboard load
2. Network monitoring - reduced API calls to Clerk
3. Database monitoring - reduced queries to users/shops tables
4. Performance monitoring - faster dashboard load times

## Testing

- Added unit tests to verify function structure
- Existing integration tests continue to pass
- Build process remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to API contracts

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/auth/user-shop.ts` - Added React cache wrapper
- `src/__tests__/unit/lib/auth/user-shop-cache.test.ts` - Added verification tests

## Impact

This optimization provides immediate performance benefits with zero breaking changes, making the dashboard significantly more responsive for users.
