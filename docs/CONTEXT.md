## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Context Checklist**

Before starting any task, ensure you understand:

- [ ] **What feature** am I working on? (Check PRD.md)
- [ ] **What phase** are we in? (Check PRD.md Section 12)
- [ ] **What's the data model?** (Check architecture.md Section 6)
- [ ] **What's the tech stack?** (Next.js 15+, TypeScript, MUI, Supabase)
- [ ] **Are there any feature flags?** (`trial_countdown_enabled`)
- [ ] **What are the architectural constraints?** (Mobile-first, offline-ready)

## ðŸš€ **Common Workflows**

### For Feature Development:

1. Read `@PRD.md` - Find the feature specification
2. Read `@architecture.md` - Understand data requirements
3. Check current codebase structure
4. Implement following mobile-first principles

### For Bug Fixes:

1. Understand the expected behavior from PRD
2. Check the data flow in architecture docs
3. Use GitHub MCP to search for related issues
4. Test on mobile viewport first

### For Database Changes:

1. Review schema in `architecture.md` Section 6
2. Use `@supabase:` MCP resources to check current state
3. Ensure RLS policies are maintained
4. Update migration files properly

## ðŸ“± **Key Reminders**

- **Mobile-First**: Every UI must work on mobile screens first
- **Offline-Ready**: Handle slow/no network gracefully
- **Seamstress-Focused**: Features must match real workflow needs
- **Security**: All data access through Supabase RLS
- **Performance**: Load times must be under 2s on 3G

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Always start with `@PRD.md` and `@architecture.md` to understand the full context before diving into code!
