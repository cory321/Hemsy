# Calendar Refactoring - Implementation Phases Overview

## 🎯 Project Goal

Refactor the Threadfolio V2 calendar system to efficiently handle hundreds of thousands of appointments using React Query, sliding window fetching, and optimized database queries.

## 📋 Phase Summary

### Phase 1: Dependencies & Setup (30 min)

**File**: `PHASE_1_DEPENDENCIES_SETUP.md`

- Install React Query and related packages
- Verify TypeScript configuration
- Clear build caches
- **Critical**: Must complete before other phases

### Phase 2: Database Migration (45 min)

**File**: `PHASE_2_DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`

- Apply optimized indexes for time-range queries
- Add BRIN index for large datasets
- Create atomic functions for conflict-free operations
- **Critical**: Required for performance gains

### Phase 3: React Query Integration (30 min)

**File**: `PHASE_3_REACT_QUERY_INTEGRATION.md`

- Activate QueryProvider in root layout
- Verify React Query DevTools
- Test basic query functionality
- **Dependency**: Requires Phase 1

### Phase 4: Query Hooks Implementation (45 min)

**File**: `PHASE_4_QUERY_HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- Configure React Query hooks for appointments
- Set up prefetching logic
- Test server actions and Edge API
- **Dependency**: Requires Phases 1-3

### Phase 5: UI Components Migration (60 min)

**File**: `PHASE_5_UI_COMPONENTS_MIGRATION.md`

- Replace calendar components with React Query versions
- Test all calendar views (month/week/day)
- Verify seamless navigation
- **Dependency**: Requires Phases 1-4

### Phase 6: Testing & Verification (90 min)

**File**: `PHASE_6_TESTING_VERIFICATION.md`

- Run comprehensive test suite
- Performance testing with large datasets
- E2E testing for user flows
- **Dependency**: Requires all previous phases

### Phase 7: Production Deployment (2-3 hours over 2 weeks)

**File**: `PHASE_7_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`

- Staged rollout with feature flags
- Production monitoring setup
- Gradual user migration
- **Dependency**: Requires Phase 6 completion

## 🚀 Quick Start for Implementation Agents

### For Parallel Work

These phases can be done by different agents simultaneously:

- **Agent 1**: Phase 1 (Dependencies) → Phase 3 (React Query)
- **Agent 2**: Phase 2 (Database) - Independent
- **Agent 3**: Prepare Phase 6 tests while others work

### Sequential Dependencies

```
Phase 1 ─┬─→ Phase 3 ─┬─→ Phase 4 ─→ Phase 5 ─→ Phase 6 ─→ Phase 7
         │            │
Phase 2 ─┴────────────┘
```

## 📊 Key Performance Targets

- Initial Load: < 500ms
- Navigation: < 50ms (with prefetch)
- Query Time: < 100ms (p95)
- Cache Hit Rate: > 80%
- Memory Usage: < 50MB

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React Query** v5.17.0 - Caching and state management
- **Next.js 15** - App Router with Server Actions
- **Supabase** - Database with optimized indexes
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **Edge Runtime** - Fast global API responses

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backwards Compatible**: Old and new systems can run in parallel
2. **Feature Flags**: Use for gradual rollout
3. **Monitoring**: Essential for production deployment
4. **Testing**: Never skip Phase 6
5. **Rollback**: Always have a plan ready

## 🎉 Expected Outcomes

- 10x performance improvement for large datasets
- Seamless user experience with no loading spinners
- Reduced server load through intelligent caching
- Scalable architecture for future growth
