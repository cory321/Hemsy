## üöÄ Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

1. Review all architecture documents
2. Set up database schema (Document 2)
3. Configure Stripe integration (Document 3)
4. Implement base Server Actions (Document 4)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)

1. Build invoice CRUD operations
2. Implement payment processing flows
3. Add email notifications
4. Ensure security compliance (Document 5)

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5)

1. Apply mobile optimizations (Document 6)
2. Add offline capabilities
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Complete testing suite

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Week 6)

1. Security audit
2. Performance testing
3. Documentation updates
4. Production deployment

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.17.1 (LTS)
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Stripe account with API keys
- Clerk authentication configured

### Environment Variables

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Test keys for development
STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Feature Flags
PAYMENT_BEFORE_SERVICE_ENABLED=true
PAYMENT_AFTER_SERVICE_ENABLED=true
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check performance budget
npm run perf:check
```

## üìã Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Server Actions Over API Routes**: Leverages Next.js 15+ for better DX and performance
2. **Stripe for All Card Payments**: Ensures PCI compliance without handling sensitive data
3. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Better perceived performance on mobile devices
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without JavaScript
5. **Mobile-First Design**: Every decision prioritizes mobile experience

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Required Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: 80% minimum coverage
- Integration Tests: All Server Actions
- E2E Tests: Complete payment flows
- Performance Tests: Core Web Vitals targets
- Security Tests: OWASP compliance

### Test Commands

```bash
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e          # E2E tests with Playwright
npm run test:security     # Security scanning
npm run test:perf         # Performance testing
```

## üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] All payment data tokenized via Stripe
- [ ] RLS policies configured for all tables
- [ ] Webhook signatures verified
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on payment pages
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

- Payment success rate
- Average payment processing time
- Invoice creation to payment time
- API response times
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Error rates by type

### Monitoring Tools

- Application: Vercel Analytics
- Errors: Sentry or similar
- Performance: Core Web Vitals tracking
- Business: Custom analytics dashboard
