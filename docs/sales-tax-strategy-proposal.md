# Sales Tax Strategy Proposal for Hemsy

**Prepared By:** AI SaaS Architect  
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** Research & Proposal

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

Hemsy serves tailors across the United States using **Stripe Connect Direct Charges** where each seamstress operates as an independent merchant. This creates a **decentralized tax liability model** where each seamstress is responsible for their own sales tax compliance.

**Current Implementation:** Fixed `tax_percent` per shop (simple but risky)  
**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid model with path to Stripe Tax automation

---

## üîç **Current State Analysis**

### **Your Current Implementation**

```typescript
// shops table has: tax_percent (e.g., 7.5 for 7.5%)
const taxAmount = Math.round(afterDiscount * taxPercent);
```

### **Problems with Current Approach**

‚ùå **Inaccurate:** Single rate doesn't account for:

- Different cities/counties in same state
- Product-specific exemptions
- Destination-based vs origin-based rules
- Rate changes over time

‚ùå **Compliance Risk:**

- Each seamstress responsible for correct rates
- No threshold monitoring
- No filing assistance
- Audit risk if incorrect

‚ùå **Manual Burden:**

- Seamstresses must update rates manually
- No automatic compliance updates
- Complex multi-jurisdiction rules

---

## üéØ **Tax Liability Model for Hemsy**

### **Who Pays Taxes?**

Based on Stripe Connect Direct Charges:

```
Customer (Client)
    ‚Üì Pays total + tax
Connected Account (Seamstress) ‚Üê Merchant of Record
    ‚Üì Collects tax
    ‚Üì Files & remits to state
Tax Authority (State/Local)
```

**Key Finding from Stripe Docs:**

> "For Direct Charges with Standard accounts, connected accounts handle their own tax compliance."

### **NOT a Marketplace Facilitator**

Hemsy is a **Software Platform**, not a marketplace facilitator because:

- ‚úÖ Seamstresses control their own pricing
- ‚úÖ Direct charges (not platform facilitated)
- ‚úÖ Each seamstress has their own Stripe account
- ‚úÖ Platform doesn't hold/transfer funds

**Result:** Each seamstress is individually responsible for sales tax.

---

## üí° **Recommended Solutions**

### **Option 1: Enhanced Manual System** ‚≠ê MVP Recommended

**What:** Improve current system with better tooling

**Implementation:**

1. **Address Collection** - Require customer address (already have `mailing_address`)
2. **State-Based Rates** - Store rates per shop + state lookup
3. **Rate Management UI** - Easy tax rate updates in settings
4. **Educational Resources** - Link to state tax resources

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ $0 additional cost
- ‚úÖ Simple to implement
- ‚úÖ Seamstress maintains full control
- ‚úÖ Works for MVP

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Manual rate updates required
- ‚ùå No automatic compliance
- ‚ùå Risk of incorrect rates
- ‚ùå No multi-jurisdiction support

**Cost:** $0  
**Implementation Time:** 1-2 days

---

### **Option 2: Stripe Tax for Connected Accounts** ‚≠ê Post-MVP Recommended

**What:** Enable automatic tax calculation per seamstress

**How It Works:**

```typescript
// Each connected account configures Stripe Tax
// Platform provides UI via Connect Embedded Components

// When creating PaymentIntent:
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(
	{
		amount: totalCents,
		currency: 'usd',
		automatic_tax: { enabled: true }, // ‚Üê Stripe calculates automatically
		customer: customerWithAddress,
	},
	{
		stripeAccount: connectedAccountId,
	}
);
```

**Setup Required:**

**Per Connected Account (Seamstress):**

1. **Head Office Address** - Business location (origin for tax)
2. **Tax Registrations** - States where registered to collect
3. **Product Tax Code** - "Apparel alterations and repairs" (txcd_99999999)

**Platform Provides:**

- Connect Embedded Component for tax settings
- UI for managing registrations
- Guidance on registration requirements

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ **Automatic calculation** - Correct rates always
- ‚úÖ **Multi-jurisdiction** - Handles complex scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Threshold monitoring** - Alerts when to register
- ‚úÖ **Filing integration** - Partners with Taxually
- ‚úÖ **Rate updates** - Automatic when laws change
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Complete tax reports

**Cons:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost:** $0.025 per transaction (2.5¬¢ per invoice)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Setup complexity** - Each seamstress must configure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Address required** - Customer zip code mandatory

**Cost Breakdown:**

```
$50,000 annual volume = 500 invoices/year (avg $100)
500 √ó $0.025 = $12.50/year per seamstress

For 100 seamstresses: $1,250/year total platform
```

**Implementation Time:** 3-5 days

---

### **Option 3: Third-Party Integration** (Advanced)

**Available Integrations:**

- **Avalara** - Enterprise-grade
- **Anrok** - Modern API-first
- **Sphere** - SMB-focused

**Use Case:** Large-scale operations (500+ merchants)

**Cost:** Typically more expensive than Stripe Tax

---

## üöÄ **Recommended Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: MVP (Current State + Improvements)**

**Keep current system, add:**

1. ‚úÖ Require customer address collection
2. ‚úÖ Add tax rate management UI in settings
3. ‚úÖ Display tax disclaimer: "Tax calculated at shop's default rate"
4. ‚úÖ Link to state tax resources

**Why:** Get to market faster, defer complexity

### **Phase 2: Post-MVP (Stripe Tax Integration)**

**When to implement:**

- 10+ active seamstresses using the platform
- User feedback requests better tax handling
- Compliance concerns arise

**Implementation Steps:**

#### **1. Database Updates**

```sql
-- Add Stripe Tax tracking fields
ALTER TABLE shops
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_registrations JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

ALTER TABLE invoices
  ADD COLUMN automatic_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_calculation_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN tax_breakdown JSONB;
```

#### **2. Connect Embedded Components**

```typescript
// In settings page, add tax configuration UI
<ConnectEmbeddedComponent
  type="tax-settings"
  accountId={connectedAccountId}
  features={['tax_settings', 'tax_registrations']}
/>
```

#### **3. PaymentIntent Integration**

```typescript
// Update createPaymentIntent to support automatic tax
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(
	{
		amount: amountCents,
		currency: 'usd',
		automatic_tax: {
			enabled: shopSettings.stripe_tax_enabled,
		},
		customer: stripeCustomerId, // Must have address!
	},
	{
		stripeAccount: connectedAccountId,
	}
);
```

#### **4. Customer Address Enforcement**

```typescript
// Require full address when Stripe Tax enabled
if (shopSettings.stripe_tax_enabled && !customer.address.postal_code) {
	throw new Error('Customer zip code required for tax calculation');
}
```

---

## üí∞ **Pricing Analysis**

### **Stripe Tax Pricing**

**Pricing Tiers:**

1. **Pay-as-you-go:** $0.025/transaction (2.5¬¢)
2. **Tax Starter:** $200/month + volume discounts
3. **Tax Complete:** $500/month + filing services

**For Small Seamstress (Example):**

```
Annual Revenue: $50,000
Average Invoice: $100
Invoices/year: 500

Cost: 500 √ó $0.025 = $12.50/year
ROI: Peace of mind + compliance = priceless!
```

**For Hemsy Platform:**

```
Stripe Tax fees are charged to connected accounts, NOT platform
Platform cost: $0 (seamstresses pay)

OR

Platform can absorb fees:
100 seamstresses √ó $12.50 = $1,250/year
Add to platform costs, increase subscription fee
```

---

## üéØ **MVP Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**

### **Phase 1: Launch with Enhanced Manual** (Now)

**Keep it simple for MVP:**

1. **Improve Tax Rate Setting**

   ```typescript
   // Settings page
   <TextField
     label="Sales Tax Rate"
     value={taxPercent}
     helperText="Contact your local tax authority for accurate rates"
   />
   ```

2. **Add Tax Disclaimer**

   ```
   "Tax calculated at shop's configured rate. Seamstresses are
   responsible for accurate tax collection and filing."
   ```

3. **Collect Customer Address**

   ```typescript
   // Already have mailing_address field!
   // Just enforce it more strictly
   ```

4. **Link to Resources**
   - State-by-state tax guides
   - Registration links
   - Rate lookup tools

### **Phase 2: Offer Stripe Tax as Premium Feature** (Post-MVP)

**Positioning:**

- Basic Plan: Manual tax (current system)
- Pro Plan: Stripe Tax automation (+$10/month)

**Value Proposition:**

- "Never worry about tax rates again"
- "Automatic compliance across all states"
- "Filing assistance included"

---

## üìù **Technical Implementation Plan (Phase 2)**

### **1. Database Schema**

```sql
-- Migration: Add Stripe Tax support
ALTER TABLE shops
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_head_office JSONB,
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_preset_code TEXT DEFAULT 'txcd_99999999';

ALTER TABLE clients
  ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_exempt BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE invoices
  ADD COLUMN automatic_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_calculation JSONB;
```

### **2. Service Tax Codes**

Stripe Tax Code for alterations: **`txcd_99999999`** (General services)

Or more specific codes if available:

- Apparel alterations
- Textile repairs
- Custom tailoring

### **3. API Integration**

```typescript
// Create Stripe Customer with address
const customer = await stripe.customers.create(
	{
		name: `${client.first_name} ${client.last_name}`,
		email: client.email,
		phone: client.phone_number,
		address: {
			line1: client.mailing_address?.line1,
			city: client.mailing_address?.city,
			state: client.mailing_address?.state,
			postal_code: client.mailing_address?.postal_code,
			country: 'US',
		},
		tax: {
			validate_location: 'immediately',
		},
	},
	{
		stripeAccount: connectedAccountId,
	}
);

// Create PaymentIntent with automatic tax
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(
	{
		amount: subtotalCents, // Tax calculated separately
		currency: 'usd',
		customer: customer.id,
		automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
		metadata: {
			invoice_id: invoiceId,
		},
	},
	{
		stripeAccount: connectedAccountId,
	}
);

// Tax is automatically calculated and added
// Access via: paymentIntent.automatic_tax
```

### **4. UI Components**

**Settings Page: Tax Configuration**

```tsx
<Card>
	<CardHeader title="Tax Settings" />
	<CardContent>
		<FormControlLabel
			control={
				<Switch checked={stripeTaxEnabled} onChange={handleStripeTaxToggle} />
			}
			label="Use Stripe Tax (Automatic Calculation)"
		/>

		{!stripeTaxEnabled && (
			<TextField
				label="Default Tax Rate (%)"
				value={taxPercent}
				helperText="Manual tax rate - you're responsible for accuracy"
			/>
		)}

		{stripeTaxEnabled && (
			<Alert severity="info">
				Tax will be calculated automatically based on customer location.
				Configure your tax registrations below.
			</Alert>
		)}
	</CardContent>
</Card>;

{
	/* Stripe Tax Embedded Component */
}
{
	stripeTaxEnabled && <ConnectTaxSettings accountId={connectedAccountId} />;
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **1. Tax Liability**

Each seamstress (connected account) is **individually liable** for:

- Determining nexus (where they need to register)
- Registering with states
- Collecting correct tax
- Filing returns
- Remitting collected tax

**Platform responsibility:** Provide tools, NOT tax advice

### **2. Service Taxability**

**Varies by State!**

- **Texas:** Alterations are taxable
- **Pennsylvania:** Alterations exempt
- **California:** Depends on fabric cost vs labor
- **New York:** Generally taxable

**Stripe Tax handles this automatically** based on:

- Product tax code
- Customer location
- Registered jurisdictions

### **3. Nexus Rules**

**When to register:**

- Physical presence (shop location)
- Economic nexus (sales volume thresholds)
  - Example: California = $500,000/year
  - Example: Texas = $500,000/year

**Stripe Tax monitors this:**

- Tracks sales by jurisdiction
- Alerts when approaching thresholds
- Suggests where to register

---

## üíµ **Cost-Benefit Analysis**

### **Scenario: Medium-sized Tailor Shop**

**Annual Stats:**

- Revenue: $75,000
- Average order: $125
- Orders/year: 600
- States with nexus: 2 (home state + neighboring)

**Current System (Manual):**

```
Cost: $0
Risk: Audit could cost $5,000-$50,000 if incorrect
Time: 10 hours/year managing rates & filing
```

**Stripe Tax:**

```
Cost: 600 orders √ó $0.025 = $15/year
Risk: Minimal (Stripe handles calculations)
Time: 2 hours/year (initial setup only)

Net Benefit: ~$500-$5,000 in risk reduction
```

---

## üìã **Implementation Proposal**

### **Phase 1: MVP (Launch Now)**

**Keep Current System Enhanced:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Already have:
- tax_percent per shop
- Customer mailing_address
- Tax calculation in order flow

// ‚ûï Add minimal improvements:
1. Better UI for tax rate setting
2. Tax disclaimer on invoices
3. Address validation
4. Educational links
```

**Effort:** 4-8 hours  
**Cost:** $0  
**Risk:** Acceptable for MVP with proper disclaimers

---

### **Phase 2: Stripe Tax Integration** (Month 3-6)

**Gradual Rollout:**

#### **Month 1-2: Foundation**

1. Add Stripe Customer creation for all clients
2. Store `stripe_customer_id` in database
3. Enforce address collection
4. Add tax_enabled toggle to shop settings

#### **Month 3-4: Integration**

5. Integrate Stripe Tax API
6. Add Connect Embedded Tax components
7. Create migration path from manual ‚Üí automatic
8. Beta test with 5-10 seamstresses

#### **Month 5-6: Rollout**

9. Document setup process
10. Offer as premium feature
11. Migrate willing users
12. Monitor and optimize

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks development  
**Cost:** Per-transaction fees (seamstress pays)

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Year 2)

- Tax filing automation via Taxually integration
- Multi-state registration assistance
- Tax exemption certificate management
- Resale certificate handling
- Tax reporting dashboard

---

## üîß **Code Changes Required (Phase 2)**

### **1. Database Migration**

```sql
-- Add Stripe Tax fields
ALTER TABLE shops
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_head_office JSONB,
  ADD COLUMN tax_registrations JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

ALTER TABLE clients
  ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_exempt BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN tax_exempt_certificate TEXT;

ALTER TABLE invoices
  ADD COLUMN automatic_tax_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN stripe_tax_calculation_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN tax_breakdown JSONB;
```

### **2. Create Stripe Customer**

```typescript
// lib/actions/stripe-customers.ts
export async function createOrUpdateStripeCustomer(
	clientId: string,
	connectedAccountId: string
) {
	const client = await getClient(clientId);

	const customer = await stripe.customers.create(
		{
			name: `${client.first_name} ${client.last_name}`,
			email: client.email,
			phone: client.phone_number,
			address: parseMailingAddress(client.mailing_address),
			tax: { validate_location: 'immediately' },
			metadata: { hemsy_client_id: clientId },
		},
		{
			stripeAccount: connectedAccountId,
		}
	);

	// Save stripe_customer_id to database
	await supabase
		.from('clients')
		.update({ stripe_customer_id: customer.id })
		.eq('id', clientId);

	return customer;
}
```

### **3. Update PaymentIntent Creation**

```typescript
// Modify: lib/actions/payments.ts

// Check if Stripe Tax is enabled
const { data: shopSettings } = await supabase
	.from('shop_settings')
	.select('stripe_tax_enabled, stripe_connect_account_id')
	.eq('shop_id', shop.id)
	.single();

// Get or create Stripe Customer
let stripeCustomer;
if (shopSettings.stripe_tax_enabled) {
	stripeCustomer = await ensureStripeCustomer(
		invoice.client_id,
		shopSettings.stripe_connect_account_id
	);
}

const paymentIntentConfig: Stripe.PaymentIntentCreateParams = {
	amount: amountCents,
	currency: 'usd',
	...(shopSettings.stripe_tax_enabled && {
		automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
		customer: stripeCustomer.id,
	}),
	// ... rest of config
};
```

### **4. Settings UI Enhancement**

```tsx
// app/(app)/settings/tax/page.tsx

<Box>
	<Typography variant="h6">Tax Collection</Typography>

	<FormControl fullWidth>
		<FormLabel>Tax Calculation Method</FormLabel>
		<RadioGroup value={taxMethod}>
			<FormControlLabel
				value="manual"
				label="Manual Rate (Current)"
				control={<Radio />}
			/>
			<FormControlLabel
				value="stripe_tax"
				label="Stripe Tax (Automatic)"
				control={<Radio />}
			/>
		</RadioGroup>
	</FormControl>

	{taxMethod === 'manual' && (
		<TextField
			label="Tax Rate (%)"
			value={taxPercent}
			helperText="You're responsible for maintaining accurate rates"
		/>
	)}

	{taxMethod === 'stripe_tax' && (
		<>
			<Alert severity="warning">
				Stripe Tax costs $0.025 per transaction. Automatic calculation ensures
				compliance.
			</Alert>

			<ConnectTaxSettings accountId={connectAccountId} />
		</>
	)}
</Box>
```

**Questions for consideration:**

1. What's your target market - local single-state shops or multi-state operations?
2. Are your users tech-savvy enough to manage manual tax rates?
3. What's your pricing model - can you absorb Stripe Tax fees or pass through?
4. Timeline to launch - is 8 hours acceptable or need to ship faster?
