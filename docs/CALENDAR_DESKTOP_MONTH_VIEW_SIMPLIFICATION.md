# Calendar Desktop Month View Simplification

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Fixed Height Day Squares

- Reverted to fixed height constraints for consistent day cell sizes
- Changed grid rows from `minmax(140px, auto)` back to `1fr`
- Restored `flex: 1` and `height: '100%'` to maintain uniform grid layout
- Reverted overflow from `auto` back to `hidden` for a cleaner appearance

### 2. Simplified Appointment Display

- **Removed**: Client avatar and name from appointment cards
- **Kept**: Time with clock icon and appointment title
- Reduced padding from `1` to `0.75` for more compact cards
- Cleaner, more minimal appearance focusing on essential information
