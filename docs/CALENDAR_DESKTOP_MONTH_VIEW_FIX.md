# Calendar Desktop Month View Enhancement

## Issue

The desktop month view wasn't displaying as a proper calendar grid, potentially showing a week-like view instead.

## Solution

Enhanced the `MonthViewDesktop` component with a proper calendar grid layout optimized for desktop screens.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **True Calendar Grid Layout**

- Replaced Material UI Grid with CSS Grid for precise control
- 7 equal columns for days of the week
- Dynamic rows based on number of weeks in the month
- Fixed minimum height (140px) per day cell

### 2. **Visual Enhancements**

- **Fixed Header**: Week day names with clear separation
- **Current Day**: Highlighted with primary color border (2px)
- **Week Numbers**: Shows "W##" on first day of each week
- **Month Transitions**: Shows month name on the 1st of each month

### 3. **Improved Day Cells**

```tsx
// Each day cell features:
- Clear date display with optional month indicator
- Appointment count badge (e.g., "3" in a colored badge)
- Shop closed status as a small red badge
- Hover effects with elevation changes
- Better spacing and padding
```

### 4. **Appointment Display**

- Shows up to 3 appointments per day (optimized for space)
- Compact appointment cards with:
  - Time display with clock icon
  - Title (truncated with ellipsis)
  - Client avatar and first name
- Elevation hierarchy (first appointment has higher elevation)
- Smooth hover animations

### 5. **Desktop-Specific Optimizations**

- Larger click targets for better UX
- Professional shadows and transitions
- Consistent 1px gap between cells
- Background color variations for closed days and current day
- Z-index management for hover states

## Technical Details

### CSS Grid Implementation

```tsx
<Box
  sx={{
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(7, 1fr)',
    gridTemplateRows: `repeat(${numWeeks}, minmax(140px, 1fr))`,
    gap: 1,
    flex: 1,
    height: '100%',
  }}
>
```

### Appointment Overflow Handling

- Shows first 3 appointments clearly
- "+N more" button with icon for additional appointments
- Click to navigate to day view for full details

## Visual Comparison

- **Before**: Grid-like layout that could be confused with week view
- **After**: Clear calendar grid with proper month layout, week indicators, and professional styling

## User Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Instantly recognizable as a month calendar view
2. **Information Density**: See appointment counts and details at a glance
3. **Navigation**: Easy to spot busy days and navigate to specific dates
4. **Professional Look**: Desktop-optimized with proper spacing and interactions
