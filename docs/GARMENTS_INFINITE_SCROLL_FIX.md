# Garments Page Infinite Scroll Fix

## Problem

The garments page was experiencing two issues:

1. When scrolling to load more items, the page would jump/scroll back to the top
2. The infinite scroll would get stuck on the loading skeleton

## Root Causes

1. **Page Refresh**: The `router.replace()` call was updating the URL with cursor parameters, causing a navigation event that scrolled the page to top
2. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: The `onLoadMore` callback had too many dependencies in its dependency array, causing frequent re-creations
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error state management for failed load attempts

## Solution

Applied Next.js 15 best practices to fix the infinite scroll:

### 1. Removed URL Updates

- Removed the `router.replace()` call that was updating the cursor in the URL
- The cursor state is maintained in React state instead, preventing page refreshes

### 2. Used startTransition for State Updates

```typescript
// Use startTransition for non-urgent state updates
startTransition(() => {
  setAllGarments((prev) => {
    const existingIds = new Set(prev.map((g) => g.id));
    const newGarments = result.garments.filter((g) => !existingIds.has(g.id));
    return [...prev, ...newGarments];
  });
  setNextCursor(result.nextCursor);
  setHasMore(result.hasMore);
});
```

This prevents the UI from freezing during large state updates.

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added `loadError` state to track errors
- Display error messages to users with retry option
- Clear error state before new load attempts

### 4. Optimized useCallback Dependencies

- Removed unnecessary dependencies like `router`, `pathname`, and `currentQueryString`
- Only kept essential dependencies: `nextCursor`, `isLoadingMore`, `shopId`, `initialFilters`

### 5. Server Action Pattern

- Created dedicated `loadMoreGarments` server action in `src/lib/actions/garments-load-more.ts`
- Follows Next.js 15 server action best practices with proper error handling

## Key Next.js 15 Patterns Applied

1. **Server Actions**: Using `'use server'` directive for data fetching
2. **startTransition**: For non-urgent UI updates to keep the interface responsive
3. **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
4. **Performance**: Minimized re-renders by optimizing dependency arrays
5. **Accessibility**: Maintained keyboard and screen reader support in InfiniteScrollTrigger

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

- Unit tests for the infinite scroll functionality
- Integration tests for the server action
- Component tests for error states

## Additional Fixes Applied

### Scroll Position Loss Issue

When new garments loaded, the page was jumping to the top. This was fixed by:

1. **Using `flushSync`**: Wrapped state updates in `flushSync` from `react-dom` to ensure all state updates happen synchronously, preventing layout thrashing
2. **Disabled Scroll Anchoring**: Added `overflowAnchor: 'none'` CSS to prevent browser's automatic scroll anchoring behavior
3. **Stabilized InfiniteScrollTrigger**: Modified the trigger element positioning to prevent layout shifts

The combination of these fixes ensures smooth infinite scrolling without jumping to the top when new items load.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large lists
2. Add loading progress indicators
3. Implement retry with exponential backoff for failed requests
