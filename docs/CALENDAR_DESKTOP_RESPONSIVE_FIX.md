# Calendar Desktop Responsive Fix - Side Panel Toggle

## Issue

When the side panel was toggled (hidden) in desktop view, the calendar UI elements were getting squished and overlapping, causing a poor user experience.

## Root Causes

1. **Fixed Grid Widths**: The header Grid items had fixed `md={4}` widths that didn't adjust when more space became available
2. **No Transition Animations**: Abrupt layout changes when toggling the side panel
3. **Insufficient Responsive Spacing**: Components didn't adapt their spacing based on available width
4. **No Maximum Width Constraints**: Calendar could become too wide on very large screens

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Grid Sizing

```tsx
// Before
<Grid item xs={12} md={4}>

// After
<Grid item xs={12} md={showSidePanel ? 4 : 3}>  // Navigation
<Grid item xs={12} md={showSidePanel ? 4 : 6}>  // View Toggle
<Grid item xs={12} md={showSidePanel ? 4 : 3}>  // Actions
```

### 2. Smooth Transitions

- Added CSS transitions to main calendar area padding
- Added smooth width transition for side panel container
- Ensures visual continuity when toggling

```tsx
sx={{
  pr: showSidePanel ? 2 : 0,
  transition: 'padding 0.3s ease-in-out',
  minWidth: 0, // Prevent flex overflow
}}
```

### 3. Responsive Spacing

- Dynamic spacing in Grid container: `spacing={showSidePanel ? 2 : 3}`
- Responsive padding and margins in calendar views
- Flexible wrapping for action buttons and filter bar

### 4. Maximum Width Constraints

- Calendar views have max-width when side panel is hidden
- Prevents calendar from becoming uncomfortably wide
- Centers content on very large screens

```tsx
maxWidth: showSidePanel ? '100%' : '1600px',
mx: 'auto',
```

### 5. Additional Improvements

- **Filter Bar**: Now wraps properly and has responsive max-width
- **Time Column**: Responsive width in week view (`xs: 60, md: 80`)
- **Month View Cells**: Responsive padding and minimum heights
- **Action Buttons**: Added flex-wrap for better mobile/tablet support

## Benefits

1. **No More Overlapping**: UI elements properly adjust to available space
2. **Smooth Experience**: Transitions make toggling feel polished
3. **Better Space Utilization**: Calendar uses space efficiently without becoming too wide
4. **Consistent Layout**: Header elements maintain proper proportions
5. **Future-Proof**: Layout handles various screen sizes gracefully

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass, confirming that functionality remains intact while improving the responsive behavior.

## Visual Comparison

### Before

- Header elements overlapped when side panel was hidden
- Jarring layout shift when toggling
- Calendar could become uncomfortably wide

### After

- Header elements resize proportionally
- Smooth animation when toggling
- Maximum width prevents excessive stretching
- Better spacing distribution

The calendar now provides a professional, polished experience regardless of whether the side panel is visible or hidden.
