1. I need to ensure automation of appointment reminders in vercel using a vercel cron job.
2. I need to make Twilio a feature flag with the feature completely implemented but we won't be profitable if we launch this feature. We need to wait until we have about 10 MAUs
3. All Vercel env variables set with production keys
4. We need a Hemsy Dash stats dashboard for tracking user metrics and actions to get an accurate average of usages on the platform (how many daily emails are sent, how many dails images are uploaded, etc.)
