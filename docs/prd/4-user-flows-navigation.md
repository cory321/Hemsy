# 4. User Flows & Navigation

## Navigation Structure

- Bottom Nav (Mobile): Home, Clients, Orders, Garments, Appointments
- Overflow Menu: Services, Invoices, Settings

## Key User Flows

- Quick Action Workflow (Dashboard)
- Order Creation (client → garments → services → summary)
- Client Lookup & Profile Access
- Garment Tracking & Stage Updates
- Appointment Scheduling (conflict-free)
- Service Management
- Invoice Management (creation, sending, payment)
- Settings Flow

**Mobile-First Considerations:** Large tap targets, bottom sheets, swipe gestures, sticky action bars, toasts for feedback.
