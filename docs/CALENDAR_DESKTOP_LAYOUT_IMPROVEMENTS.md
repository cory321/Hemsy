# Calendar Desktop Layout Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the layout improvements made to the CalendarDesktop component to enhance the user experience and maintain consistent control positioning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Separated Filter from Main Controls

- **Before**: The filter was part of the main header with the view controls
- **After**: The filter has been moved to its own dedicated row below the main controls
- **Benefit**: Cleaner visual hierarchy and more space for the filter controls

### 2. Fixed-Width Control Bar

- **Before**: Control bar width changed based on whether the side panel was open/closed
- **After**: Control bar maintains consistent width regardless of side panel state
- **Benefit**: Controls remain in the same position, providing a stable user experience

### 3. Improved Layout Structure

The new layout structure follows this hierarchy:

```
CalendarDesktop
├── Fixed Header Controls (full width)
│   ├── Navigation (Month/Week/Day arrows)
│   ├── View Toggle (Month/Week/Day/Agenda buttons)
│   └── Action Buttons (Today, Toggle Panel, Refresh)
├── Filter Bar (separate row, full width)
│   └── Filter by Type dropdown with count
└── Main Content Area
    ├── Calendar View (flexible width)
    └── Side Panel (320px when open, 0 when closed)
```

### 4. Key Implementation Details

#### Layout Changes

- Changed the root container from horizontal flex to vertical flex with column direction
- Removed dynamic spacing based on `showSidePanel` state
- Used consistent Grid item sizes (md={4} for each section)
- Removed the `maxWidth` constraint that was dependent on panel state

#### Visual Improvements

- Filter now has its own Paper component for better visual separation
- Consistent padding and margins throughout
- Smooth transitions when toggling the side panel
- Calendar view always uses full available width

## Technical Benefits

1. **Predictable Layout**: Controls stay in the same position regardless of UI state
2. **Better Responsiveness**: Each section can adapt independently
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed conditional styling based on side panel state
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between controls and content

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Muscle Memory**: Users can reliably find controls in the same location
2. **Visual Clarity**: Filter being separate makes it clearer what it affects
3. **More Space**: Filter can expand without affecting other controls
4. **Smooth Interactions**: No jarring layout shifts when toggling the side panel

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass, confirming that functionality remains intact while improving the layout.
