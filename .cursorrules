# Threadfolio V2 - Cursor Project Rules

## Project Context

You are working on **Threadfolio V2**, a mobile-first PWA for seamstresses and tailoring businesses.

### 📋 **ALWAYS READ THESE FIRST:**

- `PRD.md` - Complete Product Requirements Document with features, user flows, and implementation roadmap
- `architecture.md` - System architecture, tech stack, and design decisions

### 🎯 **Core Project Info:**

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Material UI, Supabase, Clerk Auth, Stripe
- **Target Users**: Solo seamstresses, small-to-medium tailoring shops, alteration businesses
- **Key Features**: Clients, Orders, Garments, Appointments, Services, Invoices, Settings
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22.17.1 (LTS)

### 🏗️ **Architecture Principles:**

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Offline-resilient with slow-network awareness
- Server Actions for backend logic
- Supabase RLS for data security
- Optimistic UI patterns

### 📁 **Key File References:**

- Database schema and tables defined in `architecture.md` Section 6
- Implementation roadmap in `PRD.md` Section 12 (Phases 0-7)
- Feature flags: `trial_countdown_enabled`
- Environment variables listed in `architecture.md` Section 12

### 🔧 **Development Guidelines:**

1. **ALWAYS** reference the PRD and architecture docs before making suggestions
2. Follow the mobile-first design principles
3. Use Server Actions for data operations
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states
5. Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
6. Use TypeScript strictly
7. Follow the implementation phases in order
8. **MANDATORY**: Write tests alongside all feature implementations

### 🧪 **Testing Requirements (MANDATORY):**

#### **🎯 Test-First Development:**

- **NEVER** implement a feature without corresponding tests
- Write tests **BEFORE** or **ALONGSIDE** implementation, not after
- Every PR must include test coverage for new functionality
- All tests must pass before code review

#### **📊 Coverage Standards:**

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage for all business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Cover all Server Actions and API routes
- **E2E Tests**: Cover critical user journeys from PRD.md
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using axe-core

#### **🔧 Testing Stack & Patterns:**

```typescript
// Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Components: Test rendering, props, user interactions
- Server Actions: Test business logic, error handling, data validation
- Utilities: Test pure functions, data transformations
- Hooks: Test custom React hooks

// Integration Tests (Jest)
- Database operations with Supabase
- Authentication flows with Clerk
- Payment flows with Stripe
- Email/SMS integrations

// E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Complete user workflows from PRD.md Section 4
- Mobile-first testing (responsive breakpoints)
- Offline functionality testing
- Performance testing (<2s load times)

// Accessibility Tests (axe-core + Playwright)
- Automated a11y scanning on all pages
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
```

│   └── e2e/                      # Playwright E2E tests
```

#### **✅ Testing Checklist (Every Feature):**

- [ ] **Unit tests** for all components and functions
- [ ] **Integration tests** for Server Actions
- [ ] **E2E test** for main user flow
- [ ] **Accessibility test** with axe-core
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** testing
- [ ] **Error boundary** testing
- [ ] **Loading state** testing
- [ ] **TypeScript** type safety validation

#### **🚫 Definition of Done:**

A feature is **NOT COMPLETE** without:

1. ✅ Implementation code
2. ✅ Comprehensive test suite
3. ✅ All tests passing in CI
4. ✅ Coverage thresholds met
5. ✅ Accessibility compliance verified
6. ✅ Mobile testing completed

#### **🔬 Test Commands:**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

### 🚀 **Current Phase:**

Check the latest progress against the roadmap in `PRD.md` Section 12.

### 💡 **Quick Commands:**

- Read PRD: `@PRD.md`
- Read Architecture: `@architecture.md`
- Check database: Use Supabase MCP server
- Check GitHub: Use GitHub MCP server

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- Trial countdown feature is behind `trial_countdown_enabled` flag (default OFF)
- All user data must respect Supabase RLS policies
- Payment processing uses Stripe (PCI compliant)
- Email via Resend, SMS via Twilio (future)

**Remember**: This is a real production application for seamstresses. Every decision should prioritize user experience, performance, and reliability.
