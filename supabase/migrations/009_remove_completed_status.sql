-- Migration to remove 'completed' status from appointments
-- First, update any appointments with 'completed' status to 'confirmed'

-- Update existing completed appointments to confirmed
UPDATE appointments 
SET status = 'confirmed'::appointment_status 
WHERE status = 'completed'::appointment_status;

-- Create a new enum type without 'completed'
CREATE TYPE appointment_status_new AS ENUM (
  'pending',
  'declined',
  'confirmed',
  'canceled',
  'no_show'
);

-- Update the appointments table to use the new enum
ALTER TABLE appointments 
  ALTER COLUMN status DROP DEFAULT,
  ALTER COLUMN status TYPE appointment_status_new 
    USING status::text::appointment_status_new,
  ALTER COLUMN status SET DEFAULT 'confirmed'::appointment_status_new;

-- Drop the old enum type
DROP TYPE appointment_status;

-- Rename the new enum type to the original name
ALTER TYPE appointment_status_new RENAME TO appointment_status;

-- Update the check_appointment_conflict function to remove 'completed' from the exclusion list
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_appointment_conflict(
  p_shop_id UUID,
  p_date DATE,
  p_start_time TIME,
  p_end_time TIME,
  p_appointment_id UUID DEFAULT NULL
