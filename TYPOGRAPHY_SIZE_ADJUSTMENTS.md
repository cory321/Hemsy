# Typography Size Adjustments - Comfortable Baseline

## 📊 Size Comparison: Original vs Standard vs Adjusted

Your feedback about sizes feeling smaller was spot-on! Here's what I adjusted:

### Before Migration (Original Theme)

```tsx
body1:   16px, weight 600 (semibold) ← Comfortable!
body2:   16px, weight 400 (regular)  ← Comfortable!
caption: 13.76px, weight 600 (semibold) ← Comfortable!
h6:      18px, weight 700 (bold)     ← Comfortable!
```

### Initial Migration (Too Small)

```tsx
body1:   16px, weight 400 ← Lighter weight made it feel smaller
body2:   14px, weight 400 ← Actually smaller!
caption: 12px, weight 400 ← Much smaller!
h6:      16px, weight 600 ← Smaller!
```

### ✨ Adjusted (Comfortable Again!)

```tsx
body1:   16px, weight 600 (semibold) ✅ Matches original!
body2:   16px, weight 400 (regular)  ✅ Matches original!
caption: 14px, weight 600 (semibold) ✅ Close to original, more readable!
h6:      18px, weight 700 (bold)     ✅ Matches original!
h5:      18px, weight 600 (semibold) ✅ Good for emphasis
label:   16px, weight 500 (medium)   ✅ Readable forms
```

## 🎯 Key Changes for Comfort

### 1. **Body Text** - Now Bolder & More Readable

```tsx
// Before adjustment
body1: { fontSize: '1rem', fontWeight: 400 }  // Too light

// After adjustment
body1: { fontSize: '1rem', fontWeight: 600 }  // ✅ Matches your original!
```

**Impact:** All primary body text now has the comfortable semibold weight you had before.

### 2. **Caption Text** - Larger & More Visible

```tsx
// Before adjustment
caption: { fontSize: '0.75rem' }  // 12px - Too small

// After adjustment
caption: { fontSize: '0.875rem', fontWeight: 600 }  // 14px - Much better!
```

**Impact:** Helper text, labels, and small UI text are now more readable.

### 3. **Secondary Body** - Same Size as Primary

```tsx
// Before adjustment
body2: {
	fontSize: '0.875rem';
} // 14px - Smaller than primary

// After adjustment
body2: {
	fontSize: '1rem';
} // 16px - Same as body1, just lighter weight
```

**Impact:** No jarring size differences between primary and secondary text.

### 4. **Headings** - Larger Baseline

```tsx
// Before adjustment
h6: { fontSize: '1rem' }  // 16px

// After adjustment
h6: { fontSize: '1.125rem', fontWeight: 700 }  // 18px - Matches original!
```

**Impact:** Small headings are now properly distinct from body text.

### Use These Variants for Comfort

| Element           | Variant      | Size | Weight  | Why                   |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---- | ------- | --------------------- |
| Main content      | `body1`      | 16px | 600     | Bold & readable       |
| Secondary content | `body2`      | 16px | 400     | Same size, lighter    |

### Font Weight Matters!

The same 16px can feel different based on weight:

- **body1** (16px, weight 600) = Bold, prominent
- **body2** (16px, weight 400) = Light, secondary
- **h6** (18px, weight 700) = Strong heading
